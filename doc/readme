Hello, 

I'm Ax.
I'm going to share the project how I build web service using Spring and Jersey.

Development Environment
-----------------------
IDE: Eclipse
Java: JDK 1.7
Maven: 3.x
Tomcat: 7.x

Release v0.0.4
Add paging for list
### Usage ###
~~~~
// Retrieving a list of note
GET /note/list, /note/list?pn=1
Content-Type: application/json
~~~~

Release v0.0.3
Add some classes for handling database using sqlmap 
### Guide ###
~~~~
You DO need to install MySQL and add user for this. 
Please, take a look at jdbc.properties in src/main/resources/config and edit url, username and password (FYI, I'm planning to add a class to encrypt password).
There is a sql file name data.sql in doc/sql. Please run it.
